# 📊 FinSearch - Asset Pricing Theory
FinSearch is a financial analysis project developed during our second year at IIT Bombay, aimed at exploring asset pricing theory and optimizing portfolio allocation using real-world stock data from Nifty50 (Jan-2010 to Jun-2019). This project focuses on evaluating the risk and return profiles of various financial assets and leverages key financial models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Sharpe's Ratio for portfolio optimization. 🏦📈

## 🌟 Project Objectives
Understanding Financial Assets:
Explore and analyze various asset classes such as Fixed Deposits, Gold, Bonds, Stocks, and Cash, identifying their unique characteristics, advantages, and risks.

### Asset Pricing Theory:
Study fundamental asset pricing theories, including the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), to understand the relationship between risk and expected return.

### Return-Risk Scenarios:
Construct diverse return-risk scenarios and apply portfolio optimization techniques to determine the optimal allocation of assets for achieving maximum returns with minimized risk. 🚀

## 🔧 Features
CAPM and Sharpe’s Ratio:
Applied these financial models to determine the optimal asset allocation based on historical data. 📉

### Portfolio Optimization:
Utilized expected returns, volatility, and liquidity parameters to design an efficient portfolio.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
Python: NumPy, Pandas
SciPy Optimization Algorithms: SLSQP (Sequential Least Squares Programming) for optimizing portfolio weights.
## 🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository and execute the Python scripts to:

Explore asset price theory and financial models.
Perform portfolio optimization based on Nifty50 stock data.
